# Titanic-Classification


# Method
Below are provided the steps that were followed for this project. Each step and classifiers have their own document.

#Data visualization: data analysis to understand missing values, data relations and usefulness of features
#Preprocessing: with the knowledge acquired with the preceding step, apply preprocessing of data including dealing with missing values, drop unuseful features and build new features
#Classifier: build classifiers based on the preprocessed data using a variety of techniques
